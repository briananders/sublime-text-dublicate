# Sublime Text Duplicate for VSCode

This extension duplicates strings like Sublime Text. Anything that gets highlighted gets duplicated, rather than the entire lines even when just a part of a string is highlighted.

## Use

To use these commands, press ⌘+p and enter Sublime Duplicate Text. I like to set ⌘+⇧+d to Sublime Duplicate Text so it just works as I am used to.
